                <h4><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">This privacy policy (“policy”) describes how the website operator (“website operator”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, protects, and uses the personally identifiable information (“personal information”) that you (“user”, “you”, or “your”) may provide on the Signum.Network website and any of its products or services (collectively, “website”, or “services”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>Automatic collection of information</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">When you visit the website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device’s IP address, your browser type and version, your operating system type and version, your language preferences, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our website, pages of our website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information that you search for on our website, access times and dates, and other statistics.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>Collection of personal information</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. However, if you wish to use some of the website’s features, you will be asked to provide certain personal information. For example, if you use our blockchain explorer to view your on-chain activities, you will be asked to provide your Signum address.&nbsp; We receive and store any information that you knowingly provide to us when you publish content or complete any forms on the website. You can choose not to provide us with your personal information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the website’s features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory should not enter any information on the website.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>Use and processing of collected information</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Any of the information that we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; to improve our website; to improve customer service; to respond to the queries and emails of our customers; to send newsletters; to send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc.; and to run and operate our website and services. Information collected automatically is only used to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.<br><br>We may process personal information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes. Under some jurisdictions,&nbsp;until you object to such processing by opting out, we may be allowed to process information without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. However, this does not apply whenever the processing of personal information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by a third party or by us. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, particularly whether the provision of personal information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>Information transfer and storage</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer occurs, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>The rights of users</strong><br></h4>

This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>The right to object to processing</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Where personal information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. However, should your personal information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether we are processing personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>How to exercise these rights</strong><br></h4>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">The website uses “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

                <h4><strong>Do Not Track signals</strong><br></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Some browsers incorporate a "do not track" feature that signals to the websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the do not track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to do not track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.<br></p>
